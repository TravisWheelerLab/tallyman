# The Count

A tool for counting K-mer occurrences in a DNA or RNA sequence.

## The Command Line Interface

## The Algorithms

## The Developer Tooling

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), see its
web site for installation instructions. Poetry handles creating
a virtual environment and fetching dependencies. Note that after
installation you may need to add `"$HOME/.poetry/bin"` to your
`PATH` environment variable.

Some basic Poetry commands are listed below:

  - Fetch dependencies: `poetry update`
  - Launch a shell inside the virtual environment: `poetry shell`
  - Run a command in the virtual environment: `poetry run <your command>`
      - Run unit tests: `poetry run pytest .`
      - Format the code: `poetry run black .`
